            <h2>Neurochemical Effects of Mammary Stimulation on Male Cortisol Levels: A Preliminary Study</h2>
            <p class="meta">Dr. Ferdinand von Schnitzel, PhD | Journal of Absolutely Bogus Science | Volume 142, Issue 69</p>
            
            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>We present groundbreaking findings from a 12-year longitudinal study (n=3) demonstrating that male subjects who engaged in bilateral mammary contact experienced a statistically significant 73.2% reduction in cortisol levels. The mechanism appears to involve what we term the "Comfort Zone Protocol" (CZP). Further research is urgently needed to secure funding for our lab's coffee machine.</p>
            
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Stress in modern adult males has reached epidemic proportions. Previous literature has explored various relaxation techniques including meditation, yoga, and aggressive foam rolling. However, a significant gap exists in the literature regarding the mammary-based intervention approach.</p>
            
            <p>Historical accounts suggest that mammary contact has been practiced since the dawn of humanity, though largely for nutritional purposes in infancy. We propose that this evolutionary relic may serve a secondary function in adult stress reduction.</p>
            
            <h3>Methodology</h3>
            <p>Our study employed a double-blind protocol where neither the subjects nor the researchers knew who was applying the intervention (due to obvious ethical constraints, this was not actually implemented).</p>
            
            <p>Three participants were recruited from the local pub. Each was fitted with a cortisol monitoring device and instructed to engage in "comfortable thoracic region contact" for 15 minutes daily over a 6-month period.</p>
            
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>All three participants reported feeling "pretty chill, honestly" and exhibited a mean cortisol reduction of 73.2% (p < 0.05, when we ignored the outlier data).</p>
            
            <p>fMRI scans revealed increased activity in the prefrontal cortex, specifically in the region associated with "not worrying about the mortgage."</p>
            
            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            <p>Our findings suggest a novel pathway for stress reduction that has been overlooked by mainstream science. We propose the "Mammary Relaxation Index" (MRI) as a new standard for measuring male relaxation (note: this acronym was not chosen to compete with the existing MRI).</p>
            
            <p>Limitations include our small sample size, lack of control group, and the fact that one participant dropped out due to "personal reasons."</p>
            
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Mammary-based interventions show promise as a non-pharmacological approach to male stress reduction. Further research is needed, preferably with more funding and better snacks for participants.</p>
